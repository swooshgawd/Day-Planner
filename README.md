# Day-Planner
Homework 5
This is a work day scheduler used to plan out days at work, with time slots created for each hour. The app was created with HTML, CSS, moment.js, Bootstrap. I inputted a local storage function to help track the events throughout the day. Each time slot is color-coded based on the hour. The future hours will be green, the current hour is red, and the past hours are colored in gray.
